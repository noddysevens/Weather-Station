# Weather-Station
A Java GUI Weather station with a Live dashboard and 24 hr graphs for Australians

This Java application can be run on any system where the JVM is welcome and can be left open at all times thanks to its automatic updating and ease of use.

I designed this program to be clear and simple in displaying Bureau Of Meteorology weather information. 

#How it works
The application first requests the user's postcode. It then searches for the closest weather station on the BOM webiste, then downloads the JSON file containing the latest observations and displays the results as both a most recent dashboard and 24 hr graph. 

On the graph panel, the observation set can be selected and viewed, for example: air temperature, wind speed and humidity.

#Getting Started
Download the Zip and build using your favourite IDE or compiler.
