# Weather-Station
A Java GUI Weather station with a Live dashboard and 24 hr graphs for Australians

This Java application can be run on any system where the JVM is welcome and can be left open at all times thanks to its automatic updating and ease of use.

I designed this program to be clear and simple in displaying Bureau Of Meteorology weather information. 

#How it works
This application downloads a JSON file of weather observations, extracts the data into arrays and then displays the most recent observations on the main dashboard and the past 24 hours of observations on the graph panel.

On the graph panel, the observation set can be selected and viewed, for example: air temperature, wind speed and humidity.

#Getting Started
Getting started is easy with this application, just run the WeatherStation.jar from either the command line or double click to run.
